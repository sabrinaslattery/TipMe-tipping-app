 Submitted by: Sabrina Slattery

 Time spent: 4 hour spent in total, Work-in-Progress, Last Updated 1/15/2021

 ## User Stories

 The following **required** functionality is complete:

 * [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
 * [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

 The following **optional** features are implemented:

 * [x] UI animations
 * [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
 * [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
 * [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

 The following **additional** features are implemented:

 - [ ] Create additional tip amounts: 'Recommended' (15,18,20) and/or Manual Text Entry
 - [x] Provide information for good tipping ettiquette
 - [ ] Provide redirects to user bank app to check bank account balance
 - [ ] Settings page for app
 - [ ] Swipe for Bill Splitting, create program calculations
